# React + TypeScript + Vite

Small React learning project to try out modern React API and other tools and technologies. Current state:
- The main implementation is complete
- Components tests are added (Vitest + RTL)
- Typescript

Plans:
- Storybook
- Add styling (either just CSS or something fancy like Tailwind and/or Daisy UI)
- Expand this project to support online playing (so adding some sort of server side logic); adding new features for practice; probably moving it to other repo for multiple games collection
